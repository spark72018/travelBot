Please read these terms and conditions of use carefully before using the
NavBuddy service. By accessing or utilizing NavBuddy, you are also agreeing to
be bound by Google's Maps APIs Terms of Service which can be found here:

********************************************************************************

General Rules:

NavBuddy is accessible to the general public without charge and does not require
a fee-based subscription or other fee-based restricted access. This applies to
all NavBuddy functionalities and Maps API Implementations within NavBuddy.

********************************************************************************

Privacy Policy:

NavBuddy does not allow any party to gain access to information about users,
including personally identifiable information (such as user names), or
non-personally identifiable usage information (such as saved addresses or
geocode coordinates). NavBuddy neither requests nor retains any information
regarding end user devices (mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop, etc).

  Geolocation privacy:

  NavBuddy has access to the user's Slack information (such as channel,
  username, userID, etc) when approved via Slack's OAuthentication process. This
  information is purely for /mylocations and /save commands in order to properly
  identify a user.

  A location's geocode coordinates are only looked up when users invoke the
  appropriate slash command (/drive, /bike, /walk, /transit, and /mapme). This
  data does NOT enable Google to identify an individual user, and is not stored
  or cached within the database. 

  NavBuddy is incapable of obtaining the user's location or using it with other
  data providers.
